# How To Create A New Repository On GitHub
## Overview

A repository is defined as a place, building, or receptacle where things are or may be stored. 
On GitHub they serve as self-contained hubs for various types of projects, including software, themes and portfolios.
GitHub repositories allow for effective collaboration and communication on and between different teams and projects, as well as tracking the history of changes and allowing for the creation of separate "branches" to allow for work on an item without interfering with the main project or build.
