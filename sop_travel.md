Purpose  

The purpose of this document is to outline the standard operating procedures for employees travelling
for reasons of installation, training, maintenance, company trips and other business-related travel.

Application  

This document applies to all success team, technician or closely related employees who need to travel for the purposes outlined above. 

 Procedure steps 

*All ticket and hotel bookings must be made through the Navan travel management application set up by HR. If you do not have access to the business' account through this app, contact HR.*
1. Discuss and finalize the dates of travel with the appropriate internal parties (ie. management and fellow travelers) and the customer, if applicable.
2. Book travel to the destination through the Navan app; if traveling with other employees consolidate tickets and hotel bookings if at all possible. The app will inform you if the options you choose are in or out of policy. If possible, confirm with HR before selecting an out of policy booking.
3. While traveling, use the Navan app to record all additional expenses, such as food and rideshares. *Personal expenses are not to be recorded on the app.*

Resources  

If you have questions about the app you may consult HR, a co-worker, or the Navan End User Guide found [here](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/).
