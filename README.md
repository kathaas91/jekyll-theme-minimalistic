# About Me

My name is Kat Haas and this GitHub/Page is intended to host a portfolio of my technical writing work.  

I have a Bachelor's in History from West Chester University of Pennsylvania, which helped to facillitate strong writing and research skills.  

This portfolio is intended to display the range of technical communication documentation I have created, both personally and professionally.  

My body of work includes:  
* User guides   
* Company brand style guides  
* FAQs and Knowledge Bases
* Software installation guides
* Software feature tutorials
* Internal documentation

Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. You may contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-haas/) or at [kathaas@msn.com](mailto:kathaas@msn.com).
